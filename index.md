## About Me

Software Engineer experienced in developing real-time embedded systems, internationalized Microsoft Windows-based applications, and regulated medical device software. Acquired a broad range of skills in all software development life cycle phases, from requirements gathering and design to systems implementation and testing. Strong analytical, diagnostic, and problem-solving abilities.

Recognized within QuidelOrtho as a Laboratory Information System (LIS) Subject Matter Expert for Ortho Immunohematology (IH) Instruments from 2015 through 2025. Supported Vision, Connect, Optix Reader, ProVue, AutoVue, and ITM instruments and middleware).

Managed Resx files for new releases: Responsible for maintaining an extensive collection of Resx string files for a family of four instruments that shared many of the same strings. I developed processes and procedures to ensure the accuracy and verification of the collection. I also developed tools to automate the identification of new and modified strings, the extraction of new and modified strings so they could be sent out for translations, and the integration of translated strings back into the collection. The collection contained about 700 files, partitioned by instrument and subsystems. 

Team member in the development of a new high-speed production scanner. Responsible for customizing a pSOS+ board support package for a PowerPC 403 based control board. Coordinated development activities between electrical engineer, OS vendor, consultants, and project team. Tracked the timely resolution of problems. Responsible for the specification, design, and implementation of all custom components. Managed contractor development activities. Created and executed acceptance tests.

Designed and developed a real-time embedded subsystem communication module for a family of digital presses that targets complex, high-volume scan-store-assemble print production jobs. Responsible for all phases of the development process, from requirements gathering through design, implementation, and testing.

## [ASTM E1394 Message Parsing](https://twgenaux.github.io/ASTME1394MessagParsing/ASTME1394MessagParsing)  

This project demonstrates generically parsing ASTM  E1394 (a.k.a LIS2) messages. It is a prototype demonstrating a method to parse any ASTM  E1394 (ASTM) message and return key/value pairs containing all the information in the message. These key/value pairs can be used to recreate an equivalent ASTM message.
