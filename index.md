# About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience in developing real-time, event-driven embedded systems, internationalized Microsoft Windows-based applications, and software for regulated medical devices. Acquired a broad range of skills in all software development life cycle phases, from requirements gathering and design to systems implementation and testing. Strong analytical, diagnostic, and problem-solving abilities.

# My Career

I began my career as a Digital Systems Technician (DST) at Kodak, then transitioned into software engineering. A few years later, I returned to college to earn my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## [Introduction to ASTM E1394 and LIS02-A2 Message Formats](https://twgenaux.github.io/MessageFormats/MessageFormats)

â€‹	A basic introduction to the ASTM E1394 and LIS02 message formats for non-programmers.

## [ASTM E1394 Message Parsing](https://twgenaux.github.io/ASTME1394MessagParsing/ASTME1394MessagParsing)  

This project demonstrates the generic parsing of ASTM E1394 (also known as LIS2) messages. It is a prototype that shows a method for parsing any ASTM E1394 (ASTM) message and returning key/value pairs containing all the information in the message. These key/value pairs can be used to recreate an equivalent ASTM message. I'm continuing to revise and expand my approach as time permits.
