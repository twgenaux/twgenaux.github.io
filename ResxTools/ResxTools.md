A Resx file (.resx) is a .NET Resource format for storing localizable resources. It is an XML-based file format with a pre-defined syntax to keep resources organized and accessible. The .resx files are monolingual, meaning each file is designated to hold resources for a single language. 

These tools are designed to work only with strings. The tools would have to be extended to handle other resource types, such as images or object data.

> TODO - Consider extending the tool set to include images and object data.
