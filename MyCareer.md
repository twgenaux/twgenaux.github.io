# My Career

I began my career as a Digital Systems Technician (DST) at Kodak, then transitioned into software engineering. A few years later, I returned to college to earn my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My first job was at Kodak's instant print manufacturing in Kodak Park. The entire building was an embedded system, with minimal human interaction with the raw materials or products. There were approximately 75 DEC PDP-11 computers throughout the building, with many of them performing real-time control of the large Continuous Motion Assembly Machines (COMAMs). The COMAMs assembled the individual, unexposed picture units (PU) from a continuously moving layer of webs while adding some components. The PUs were then stacked into a pack, and a cover was sealed on top. The packs were then fed on an air conveyor to an accumulator for quality inspection. When released, they were sent on another air conveyor, where they were packaged for sale and boxed for shipping.

 Additionally, there were many microcontrollers and digital systems. I was impressed with the COMAM hardware simulator, which was driven by a variable oscillator feed to a counter that produced an address to a bank of PROMs, whose output simulated the inputs and interrupts to the software.  

**Working at Kodak's instant print manufacturing was an invaluable learning experience**, as it provided <u>a great introduction to real-time event-driven software</u>. I ended up writing assembly code, Intelâ€™s PL/M, and updating various small, real-time event-driven microcontrollers. I also worked with computer engineers, developing code for testing new microcontroller boards. I often suggested improvements to make the boards fully testable and speed up the performance of their target applications. I investigated numerous issues that required understanding the systems and software, which enabled me to identify necessary changes.

My first unofficial work as a software engineer was on a Kodak venture project, where I wrote all the low-level device drivers for what was at the time a general-purpose tablet computer with a CD drive, targeting field service engineers. This project ended when, at one meeting, someone walked in with one of the first laptop computers. 

Because of my work on the venture project, I was hired as a software engineer by an internal group that outsourced engineers as needed for new projects. 

The next 15+ years at Kodak were spent developing small and medium-sized C/C++ real-time event-driven embedded systems. My last project at Kodak was a C++ desktop application for configuring print jobs targeting digital high-volume production printers.

I then went to work at Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics for another 15+ years, where I initially worked on legacy C++ Immunohematology (IH) middleware and instruments. I also worked on a C# project, developing a new automated donor screening pipettor. Over the last few years, I primarily supported the Vision IH family of instruments as 3rd-level support, assisting customers, field service personnel, and vendors. I also directly supported some of Vision's C# based subsystems. During that period, I supported the development of new IH middleware and low-volume instruments.
